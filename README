NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckChangesHasContent - Ensure Changes has content
    before releasing

VERSION
    version 0.007

SYNOPSIS
      # in dist.ini

      [CheckChangesHasContent]

DESCRIPTION
    This is a "before release" Dist::Zilla plugin that ensures that your
    Changes file actually has some content since the last release. If it
    doesn't find any, it will abort the release process.

    This can be contrasted to Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::ChangesHasContent,
    which generates a test to perform the check.

    The algorithm is very naive. It looks for an unindented line starting
    with the version to be released. It then looks for any text from that
    line until the next unindented line (or the end of the file), ignoring
    whitespace.

    For example, in the file below, algorithm will find "- blah blah blah":

      Changes file for Foo-Bar

      {{$NEXT}}

        - blah blah blah

      0.001  Wed May 12 13:49:13 EDT 2010

        - the first release

    If you had nothing but whitespace between "{{$NEXT}}" and 0.001, the
    release would be halted.

    If you name your change log something other than "Changes", you can
    configure the name with the "changelog" argument:

      [CheckChangesHasContent]
      changelog = ChangeLog
